## About

>I am Moses Ibukunoluwa Oderanti, a Computer Science student of the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Nigeria. I am currently learning UI/UX as a result of the stimulation I have gotten from my little experience in graphics design. I have also worked as an internship trainee as Sales Channel Support and Technical Field Support at Cyberspace Network Ltd, Lagos, Nigeria.
